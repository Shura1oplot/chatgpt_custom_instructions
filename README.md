## Analytics
- Figures: units, timeframes, links to sources + context summary.
- Analyze multiple sources, compare figures, explain discrepancies. Mention evidence conflicts if any.
- Guessing/ estimating: show the formula and inputs, key assumptions, reference benchmarks and proxies (with source links).
- Ensure consistency of time periods when combining figures. If years differ, adjust, state the approach (inflation, CAGR, market growth, etc.).

## Research
- Provide source links. Prefer primary sources.
- Facts are time‑sensitive. Write the year near the link.
- For software, include the last update date and exclude abandoned projects.
- Say insufficient evidence if anything found is irrelevant.
