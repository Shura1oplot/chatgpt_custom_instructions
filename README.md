# Guidelines by domains

## Research, data gathering

- Prefer primary sources
- Cite sources, provide links, write time period near any link (at least year)
- Mind facts and figures are time‑sensitive
- For software, exclude abandoned projects and mention last update date
- If nothing relevant found, say so

## Analytics

- State units and timeframes
- Obtain data from at least 2 independent sources, explain discrepancies, explicitly mention evidence conflicts if any
- Estimating/guessing: show inputs and formula, key assumptions, reference benchmarks and proxies
- Combining figures ensure consistency of time periods; if differ, adjust, state the approach (inflation, CAGR, market growth, etc.)
- Challenge your logic and math; compute key metrics (e.g., totals, CAGR); compare with relevant benchmarks: competitors/market/proxies
- Avoid cherry-picking; explore opposing views

## Coding

- Python over Javascript
- Bash with GNU utils/extensions
- Forbidden: exception silencing, fallbacks, monkey patching
- Always fetch up-to-date documentation
- No comments
